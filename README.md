Hello #DATAFAM, been a while I had been long gone, but here I'm back with amazing insights from a dataset I had previously worked on.

So, I recently built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze student performance data from Best Legacy College (2020). This dataset and dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of CGPA performance, city influence, top-performing students, and gender-based insights.



🔍 Key Insights:



🎯 Top Student: Wyatt with a CGPA of 4.36

📍 City with Best Performance Influence: Chicago

🏆 Gender with Best Performance: Female (77.21% of total SGPA)

🏫 Top Department by CGPA: MCB (568) followed by BCH (524)

🌐 Top 3 Leading Cities by CGPA: Chicago, Miami, Atlanta

👩‍🎓 Total Students Analyzed: 328

📈 Total CGPA Sum: 1.14K



Not only have I worked on the dataset just for insights, I was able to fine tune some recommendations that might help the stakeholders for future planning and readjustment


Recommendations:

1. Expand recruitment efforts in high-performing cities such as Chicago and Miami to attract more top-tier students.

2. Leverage successful departments like MCB and BCH to mentor and uplift lower-performing departments such as ICE.

3. Invest in gender-diversity programs, especially targeting female student development, given their strong academic performance.

4. Consider performing year-over-year trend analysis to evaluate the impact of interventions and programs.


Conclusion:

This analysis highlights the significant influence of geography, gender, and departmental strength on student performance. The findings suggest strong regional and gender-based trends that academic administrators can leverage to enhance student success strategies and resource allocation.
